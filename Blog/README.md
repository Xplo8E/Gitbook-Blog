# Me

Hey everyone, I'm Vinay Kumar Rasala, a security researcher at [Appknox](https://www.appknox.com/). My days are all about digging into mobile and web apps, sniffing out those sneaky vulnerabilities to keep them safe and sound. And hey, I'm not just about the tech grind—I'm all about soaking up knowledge, especially when it comes to AI and whatever else the future throws our way. Because in this fast-paced world of cybersecurity, staying ahead of the curve isn't just a hobby—it's a necessity.\
\
Outside of work, I'm really into Japanese anime and manga. I spend my free time watching anime and reading manga. That's why you'll see lots of Japanese pictures on my blog. I like to share the fun and beauty of anime and manga with everyone.
